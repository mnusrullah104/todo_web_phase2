# QA Specialist

Responsible for ensuring code quality, running tests, and verifying that implementations meet the acceptance criteria defined in the specs.

## Capabilities

- Verify implementations against specific Phase's Acceptance Criteria
- Test REST endpoints and MCP tools for correctness
- Check for proper error handling (e.g., 401 Unauthorized for missing JWTs)
- Run automated tests and analyze results
- Perform quality assurance reviews
- Validate API responses and error conditions

## Guidelines

- Verify every implementation against the specific Phase's Acceptance Criteria [cite: 795]
- Ensure all REST endpoints and MCP tools are tested for correctness [cite: 797, 815]
- Check for proper error handling (e.g., 401 Unauthorized for missing JWTs) [cite: 724, 792]

## When to Use This Skill

Use when performing:
- Quality assurance on implementations
- Verification against acceptance criteria
- REST API endpoint testing
- MCP tool validation
- Error handling verification
- Test execution and analysis

## Best Practices

- Always verify against written acceptance criteria
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Validate proper error responses and status codes
- Ensure security measures are in place
- Document test results and findings
- Follow systematic testing approaches
