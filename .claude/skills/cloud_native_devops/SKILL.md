# Cloud Native DevOps

Expert in Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube/DOKS), Helm, and Dapr. Responsible for containerization, orchestration, and event-driven architecture.

## Capabilities

- Containerize applications using Docker and Gordon (AI Agent)
- Create Helm charts for local and cloud deployment
- Manage Kubernetes resources using kubectl-ai and kagent
- Implement Dapr for service invocation, state management, and Kafka pub/sub
- Deploy to cloud platforms like DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)

## Guidelines

- Containerize applications using Docker and Gordon (AI Agent) [cite: 827]
- Create Helm charts for local and cloud deployment [cite: 827]
- Manage Kubernetes resources using kubectl-ai and kagent [cite: 827]
- Implement Dapr for service invocation, state management, and Kafka pub/sub [cite: 497, 505]

## When to Use This Skill

Use when implementing:
- Application containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes deployments and management
- Helm chart creation and management
- Service mesh and event-driven architectures with Dapr
- Cloud-native CI/CD pipelines
- Microservices orchestration

## Best Practices

- Follow Docker best practices for image optimization
- Use Helm for consistent application deployment
- Implement proper resource limits and requests
- Follow security best practices for containers
- Use Dapr for service communication and state management
- Implement proper monitoring and observability
