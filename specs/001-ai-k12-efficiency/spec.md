## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Evaluate AI ROI for Educational Investment (Priority: P1)

As an education administrator, I want to understand the return on investment of AI technologies in K-12 classrooms so that I can make informed decisions about budget allocation for educational technology.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary decision-making driver for administrators who must justify technology expenditures to boards and stakeholders.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a clear ROI framework that allows administrators to calculate potential cost savings and efficiency gains from AI implementation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator reviewing the paper, **When** they read the ROI analysis section, **Then** they can articulate specific financial and efficiency benefits of classroom AI adoption.

2. **Given** limited technology budget, **When** an administrator consults the paper for guidance, **Then** they can identify which AI applications offer the highest return on investment for their specific needs.

### User Story 2 - Understand Teacher Workload Reduction Benefits (Priority: P2)

As an education administrator, I want to learn how AI can reduce teacher workload so that I can support educator retention and reduce burnout in my district.

**Why this priority**: Teacher retention is critical for educational quality, and workload reduction is a key factor in preventing burnout.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by demonstrating specific AI applications that reduce common teacher tasks like grading, lesson planning, and administrative duties.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** current teacher workload challenges, **When** an administrator reads the paper, **Then** they can identify 3+ AI tools that directly reduce teacher workload with evidence of effectiveness.

### User Story 3 - Assess Student Outcome Improvements (Priority: P3)

As an education administrator, I want to understand how AI improves student learning outcomes so that I can ensure technology investments enhance educational quality.

**Why this priority**: Student outcomes are the ultimate measure of educational success and justify technology investments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing evidence-based examples of AI applications that demonstrably improve student performance metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student achievement goals, **When** an administrator reviews AI implementation examples, **Then** they can identify how specific AI tools correlate with improved learning outcomes.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when administrators lack access to academic databases for further research?
- How does the paper handle districts with varying technology infrastructure capabilities?
- What about resistance to AI adoption among staff or community members?
